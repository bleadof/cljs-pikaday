# cljs-pikaday

This is a work in progress.

cljs-pikaday is intended to provide a native ClojureScript interface to the 
[Pikaday](https://github.com/dbushell/Pikaday) JavaScript date picker, intended 
for use in the various ClojureScript react frameworks.

To start with I'd like to get it working in reagent, and add in some nicer 
suport for re-frame. Longer-term I'd like to add in Om support as well.

Currently this is structured as a plain reagent project creted via 
`lein new reagent`; once the kinks are worked out I'll split the example 
project into its own directory and push to clojars.
